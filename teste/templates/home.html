                This is a Bootstrap 4 example layout that includes a Sidebar menu. On larger screen widths, the Sidebar is on the 
                left side and consumes the entire page height. It's vertically positioned down the screen. On smaller screen widths (like mobile phones and tablets), the Sidebar
                moves to the top of the page, and becomes horizontally positioned across the page like a Navbar. Only icons are shown
                on mobile to limit use of screen real estate.

                This Sidebar works using only Bootstrap CSS classes and doesn't require JavaScript. It utilizes the responsive Navbar classes
                to auto-magically switch the Sidebar orientation.
